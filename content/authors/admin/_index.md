I am a graduate student at University of Toronto specialising in Computer Vision and Machine Learning. Apart from being a full time student I am a Computer Vision developer at JACOBB AI building models for segmentation and detection in 3D scenes. My interests are inclined towards Machine Vision and Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality. 

I am also a part of Nightingale AI where I work as Computer Vision Engineer where I am working on creating an API to help patients recover from knee joint injuries.
